# Lambda (λ)

A Custom Reverse Proxy with Real-Time Packet Capture and Traffic Analysis.

## Notes

1. **Package Manager**: `pnpm`
2. **Node Version**: Using `v26.7.0` locally (see `.nvmrc`)
3. **Ports**: Proxy `:8080`, Stub `:3001`, Dashboard `:3000`, Redis `:6379`

## Getting started

```bash
pnpm install
cp .env.example .env
```

### Docker access

```bash
sudo docker compose up -d      # not: pnpm infra:up
```

`pnpm infra:up` currently runs `docker compose` without `sudo` and will fail
with `permission denied ... /var/run/docker.sock`. Prefix with `sudo` for now,
or update the script once you decide which way to go.

## Environment

`.env` holds machine-specific config. Two values matter most:

| Variable          | Notes                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `CAPTURE_IFACE`   | **Must be the physical NIC, never `lo`.** A container's loopback is namespace-isolated and sees no host traffic — capture goes silent in a way that looks identical to a broken parser |
| `PROXY_PORT` etc. | Change only if a port is genuinely taken                                                                                                                                               |

Redis is reached over the compose network and is **not** published to the host
or LAN. It has no authentication and no TLS, so keep it that way.

## Storage

There is no database in v1. Recent history lives in a capped Redis list —
`LPUSH frames <json>` followed by `LTRIM frames 0 <HISTORY_LIMIT>` — which
cannot grow without bound. Postgres was cut deliberately; see issue #5.

## Repository layout

```text

  stub/        traffic-shaping upstream
  dashboard/   Next.js real-time dashboard
packages/
  config/      shared tsconfig
stress-test/   load generator (runs on the second laptop)

```

## Commands

| Command                        | Purpose                                                   |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| `pnpm install`                 | Install workspace dependencies                            |
| `pnpm typecheck`               | Typecheck all packages                                    |
| `pnpm build`                   | Build all packages                                        |
| `pnpm lint`                    | Lint all packages                                         |
| `pnpm infra:up` / `infra:down` | Start/stop Docker services (**needs `sudo`** — see above) |

## Continuous integration

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs on every PR to `main` in two jobs:

- **`verify`** — typecheck, build and lint.
- **`docker`** — `docker compose config`, builds both images, starts the stack,
  asserts `/health` on the proxy and stub, asserts the proxy container runs as
  non-root, and asserts libpcap is present in the runtime image.

The `docker` job exists because the TypeScript job is blind to container
problems. A musl/glibc mismatch, a missing `pnpm` install, or a build context
that cannot reach `pnpm-lock.yaml` all build fine locally on the right
hardware and only fail in the image — so without it, those reach `main`
unnoticed.

`.github/workflows/codeql.yml` runs CodeQL security scanning (daily PR +
weekly).

Two things CI deliberately does **not** do:

- **Live pcap capture.** Needs `CAP_NET_RAW` and a host interface, which
  GitHub-hosted runners do not grant. The `test` step stays commented until
  there are unit tests that need no privileges — the packet parser, RTT
  estimator and reassembly buffer are pure functions over known inputs, and
  those are where the test value is anyway.
- **Port-forwarded or `NET_ADMIN` behaviour checks beyond the smoke test.**
  The `NET_ADMIN` grant is asserted by capability, not by running `tc`.

`pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` in CI means **a PR that edits `package.json`
without regenerating `pnpm-lock.yaml` will fail.** Run `pnpm install` and commit
the lockfile alongside dependency changes.

One gotcha worth knowing: a workspace package with **zero dependencies** gets
no `importers[...]` entry in the lockfile, which then fails
`--frozen-lockfile`. Every workspace package needs at least one devDependency.

## Dependency notes

- `@audc/pcap` — libpcap bindings, ships linux-x64 prebuilds so no compiler
  toolchain is needed in CI. Requires `allowBuilds` in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
- TypeScript is pinned to `~5.9`. `typescript-eslint` does not yet support TS 7.
